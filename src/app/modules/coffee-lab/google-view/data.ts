            '<p><span>Welcome to Era of We, we’re excited to have you on board! As a member of the platform, you get access to The Coffee Lab—a complete resource guide for coffee knowledge. Whether you’re interested in learning more about a coffee processing technique, tips for roasting light profile coffees, or how to brew a French press, this is where you’re going to learn how to do it! </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>To put it simply, you can think of The Coffee Lab as a Reddit or Quora for coffee. Our question-and-answer platform allows users to connect with other coffee lovers from all backgrounds of the coffee community. You don’t have to be a coffee roaster or a coffee farmer to answer questions, and you don’t have to be a coffee drinker to ask them. Era of We is driven by knowledge sharing to level out the opportunities to all members of the coffee community. The more we spend time talking to each other and listening to each other, the stronger we grow as a team. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>These posts are available at any time during your log-in experience, and you also have the ability to save posts for later reading, or to reference for help if you’re in the middle of a coffee project. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span>In addition to Q&amp;A, we will also feature blog content that gets into the heart of a subject within coffee. Some topics you may see on the blog include: </span></p><p><br></p><ul><li><span>Brewing guides </span></li><li><span>Harvest </span></li><li><span>Brewing coffee manually, with drip, and  </span></li><li><span>espresso preparation (brewing recipes) </span></li><li><span>The differences between coffee regions </span></li><li><span>Gear reviews </span></li><li><span>Equipment troubleshooting </span></li><li><span>Food sustainability and traceability  </span></li><li><span>Coffee science </span></li><li><span>Drink recipes for either your bar or café </span></li><li><span>How to cup coffee</span></li><li><span>Origin data </span></li></ul><p><br></p><p><span>Once again, anybody is welcome to contribute. If there is a topic that you don’t see on the platform, or one that you would simply like to share your own thoughts about, The Coffee Lab is your place to showcase this to a global audience.  </span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Should I Participate in The Coffee Lab?</strong><span> </span></p><p><br></p><p>The Coffee Lab is an extension of our commitment to actively participate in and engage with the global coffee community. We seek to empower others through knowledge, so this feature encourages others to connect outside of business transactions. Similarly, The Coffee Lab is an organic marketing tool, a way to establish your brand as a coffee expert and validate your offerings to other users on the platform. </p><p>Plus, you’ll be entitled to discounts off the eCommerce platform for active participation, so it’s truly a win-win-win situation at The Coffee Lab. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Follow the Code of Conduct, and have fun learning!</strong><span> </span></p><p><br></p><p><span><span>﻿</span>We strive to make this community a safe space to ask questions and share knowledge. That being said, please keep in mind our code of conduct to ensure that you are participating responsibly and empowering others to succeed as you form new friendships and bond over one of the most complex yet fun subjects in the world, coffee! </span></p>',
